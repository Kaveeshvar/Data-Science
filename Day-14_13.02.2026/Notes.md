| Term | What it means in security        |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| TP   | Correctly caught attack          |
| FP   | Flagged something safe as attack |
| FN   | Missed an attack                 |
| TN   | Correctly allowed safe           |


- Too many FP → analysts drown in alerts → alert fatigue → real attacks ignored.

- Too many FN → attackers get through → business loss.
